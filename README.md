# Scribbling - A clone of Google docs  

A text editor with persistent storage, that can be accessed from the URL.  
Created using React.js, Quill, Socket.io and MongoDB.  
  
With plans to add the ability to collaborate with others in real-time using Yjs.  

## To-do:  
* Add a GIF to showcase the design and functionality on the README
* Implement Yjs collaboration feature
* Think of ways to deviate from being just a clone
* Learn and have fun!
